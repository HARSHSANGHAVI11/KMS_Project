✅ Project Overview

In many companies, employees work on projects in isolation. Knowledge about the project is often stored in personal notes or remains in the mind of individual employees.
When an employee leaves the company, critical knowledge is lost. New employees struggle to understand the project structure, business logic, or technical implementation, which leads to delays, repeated mistakes, and reduced productivity.

Our solution – the AI Powered Knowledge Management System (KMS) – solves this problem by providing a centralized, structured, and intelligent knowledge base.

🎯 Purpose

• Provide a centralized platform for employees to upload project documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
• Allow employees to structure knowledge updates under key categories (Business Logic, Security Parameters, etc.).
• Enable intelligent querying of documents and updates using AI-based question answering.
• Maintain full history of updates and chat interactions.
• Support HR with dashboards to track employee activity and provide feedback.
• Get the compititor and get the post details adn company working through scrapping
• Incident Blog automatically content writting.



This helps ensure that project knowledge is retained within the organization, accessible by anyone at any time.
