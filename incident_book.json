        "blog": "**Solving the Ticket Booking Conundrum: A Technical Fix for a Traveling Woes**\n\nBy Harsh\n\nAs travelers, we've all been there - eagerly booking tickets online, only to be met with frustration when the session code is missing or not accessible. The anticipation of exploring new destinations is suddenly replaced with anxiety and disappointment. In this blog post, I'll share my experience with a ticket booking problem and present a solution that will have you submitting your bookings in no time.\n\n**The Problem: Session Code Easiness (or Lack Thereof)**\n\nI recently encountered an issue while trying to book tickets online. After clicking the \"Book\" button, I was presented with an error message stating that the session code was not available. This was unexpected, as I had previously checked my browser's session cookies and all seemed well.\n\nThe goal was clear: submit the ticket booking successfully. However, without the session code, this seemed like a daunting task. The problem persisted even after attempting to refresh the page or trying a different browser.\n\n**The Solution: Indirect Function to the Rescue**\n\nAfter some research and experimentation, I discovered that the issue was caused by an over-loop problem in the underlying JavaScript code. To overcome this hurdle, I employed an indirect function approach, which allowed me to bypass the problematic code and successfully submit my ticket booking.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how I implemented this solution:\n\n```javascript\n// Original code:\nfunction getTicketBookingData() {\n  // Code that relies on session code...\n}\n\n// Modified code (indirect function):\nfunction getTicketBookingDataWrapper() {\n  return getTicketBookingData();\n}\n\n// Use the indirect function to submit ticket booking:\ngetTicketBookingDataWrapper().then((data) => {\n  // Submit ticket booking with the received data\n});\n```\n\nBy introducing an intermediate layer, I effectively sidestepped the over-loop issue and ensured a successful ticket booking submission.\n\n**Conclusion: Avoiding Over-Loop Problems in Ticket Booking**\n\nIn this blog post, we explored a common problem faced by travelers when booking tickets online. By employing an indirect function approach, we can avoid over-loop issues and successfully submit our bookings. This solution is not only effective but also easy to implement, making it a valuable addition to any traveler's toolkit.\n\nWhether you're a seasoned traveler or just embarking on your next adventure, I hope this technical fix has empowered you to tackle any ticket booking challenges that come your way. Happy travels!"

In my recent encounter with an errant ticket booking system, I found myself stuck in a frustrating loop. The goal was simple: book a ticket and get on with the journey. But the system had other plans, refusing to budge despite multiple attempts.\n\nThe issue arose when clicking the button to complete the booking process didn't yield the desired result \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nothing happened. No error message, no confirmation, just an unsettling silence. This was not the start I had envisioned for my trip. Frustration began to set in as I tried various approaches to trigger the ticket booking, only to be met with the same uncooperative system.\n\nDetermined to get to the bottom of this travel conundrum, I dug deeper into the code. The culprit, it turned out, was a nested loop lurking beneath the surface. This pesky construct had created a seemingly impenetrable barrier between me and my booked ticket. It was time to take matters into my own hands.\n\n**The Solution: Unraveling the Nested Loop**\n\nWith the issue identified, I set out to create a workaround that would bypass the offending code. The solution lay in using another nested loop, cleverly crafted to circumvent the original problem. This new loop acted as a proxy, allowing me to activate the ticket booking process.\n\nThe key insight was recognizing that the system's reluctance to budge was due to its inability to understand my intentions. By rephrasing the query and providing the necessary context, I effectively \"tricked\" the system into accepting my request. It was a eureka moment, indeed!\n\n**Lessons Learned: Debugging as an Art**\n\nThis experience served as a poignant reminder of the importance of patience and persistence in debugging. When faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges, it's essential to remain calm, think creatively, and be willing to dig deeper.\n\nThe takeaway from this travel conundrum? Sometimes, all it takes is a fresh perspective and a dash of creative problem-solving to overcome even the most recalcitrant issues. By embracing the art of debugging, we can turn frustrating experiences into opportunities for growth and learning.\n\n**Conclusion: Booking Success**\n\nIn the end, my perseverance paid off, and I successfully booked my ticket. The journey may have been longer than expected, but it ultimately led to a sense of accomplishment and a deeper understanding of the importance of creative problem-solving in debugging.\n\nThe next time you encounter a travel conundrum, remember: with persistence and a willingness to think outside the box, even the most stubborn issues can be overcome. Happy travels!"

        "blog": "**Solving the Hiding Button: A Journey of Debugging with Nested Loops**\n\nAuthor: Harsh\n\nAs a software developer on the Trtravel project, I recently encountered a peculiar issue that required some creative problem-solving. The ticket booking process was being hindered by a seemingly innocuous problem - a button hiding behind other UI elements. Sounds trivial, but trust me, it was a frustrating experience that tested my debugging skills.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nWhen users attempted to book tickets, they would click the \"Book Now\" button, only to be met with... nothing. No error message, no loading animation, just an unsettling silence. After some initial investigation, I discovered that the issue lay not in the code itself, but rather in the way the UI was structured.\n\nThe button was being positioned behind other elements on the page, making it invisible to users. A simple problem, one would think, yet it was causing significant frustration and impacting our users' experience.\n\n**The Goal**\n\nMy goal was straightforward: fix this issue and ensure that users could seamlessly book their tickets. But how?\n\n**The Solution**\n\nAfter some trial and error (and a few hair-pulling moments), I stumbled upon the solution: nested loops to the rescue!\n\nHere's what I did:\n\n1. Identified the offending UI elements and wrapped them in a container div.\n2. Created a nested loop that iterated over each child element of this container, checking if they overlapped with our \"Book Now\" button.\n3. If an overlap was detected, I adjusted the button's position to ensure it was visible above all other elements.\n\nWith these cleverly crafted loops, the button was finally freed from its hiding place, and users could once again book their tickets with ease.\n\n**The Takeaway**\n\nThis experience taught me a valuable lesson: even seemingly simple issues can hide complex problems beneath the surface. By thinking creatively and applying clever solutions (in this case, nested loops), we can overcome these obstacles and deliver a better user experience.\n\nAs developers, it's our job to anticipate and solve these kinds of problems before they become showstoppers. So next time you encounter an issue that seems trivial at first glance, remember: sometimes the simplest solution lies in the most unexpected places - like nested loops!"

In this post, I'll share with you a recent adventure I had while working on the ticket booking feature for our travel project, Trtravel.\n\n**The Mystery Unfolds**\n\nWhen users attempted to book tickets through our platform, they were met with an unexpected issue: the ticket booking button was nowhere to be found! After conducting some preliminary investigation, we realized that the culprit behind this enigma was none other than the browser's scrollbar. Yes, you read that correctly - a seemingly innocuous feature had inadvertently hidden the button from view.\n\n**The Goal: Unraveling the Mystery**\n\nOur mission was clear: we needed to resolve this issue and ensure a seamless booking experience for our users. We set out to identify the root cause of the problem and devise a solution that would allow us to click on the button successfully, no matter where it might be hiding.\n\n**The Solution: Leveraging Nested Loops**\n\nAfter analyzing the code and performing various tests, we decided to employ nested loops to tackle this issue. By cleverly nesting two loops - one for scrolling and another for checking the button's visibility - we were able to create a robust solution that could accommodate different scenarios:\n\n1. **Scrolling Loop**: We created a loop that simulated user interaction by scrolling through the webpage. This allowed us to cover various cases, including those where the button was partially hidden or fully visible.\n2. **Visibility Check Loop**: Within the scrolling loop, we added another loop that checked the button's visibility at each scroll position. If the button was found, we would simulate a click event to complete the booking process.\n\n**The Result: A Click-Worthy Solution**\n\nAfter implementing this solution, we were thrilled to see that the ticket booking feature was now functioning as intended. Users could comfortably book their tickets without encountering any issues related to the hidden button.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn this technical adventure, we demonstrated how a seemingly straightforward issue can be solved by employing creative problem-solving strategies and innovative coding techniques. By leveraging nested loops, we were able to overcome the pesky scrollbar problem and provide an improved user experience for our users. As developers, it's essential to stay curious, think outside the box (or in this case, the scroll bar!), and continually challenge ourselves to deliver exceptional results.\n\n**Happy Coding!**\n\nHarsh"
